# Substack
Substack is the 800lb gorilla in this space in 2022.

  - “I used to really enjoy Twitter and Instagram,” says Morby. “But it feels so manipulative: it’s selling you, rather than you selling yourself. Substack feels like eating a nourishing meal, whereas Instagram and Twitter feel like eating candy bars.”
  - "And while Substack’s future may be uncertain, it’s still offering more generous terms than music streamers. When Case learned how much the site wanted to pay her, she was in disbelief. “It was like, ‘What? You want to pay a musician for something?’ This doesn’t happen. People like Spotify are always trying to weasel you out of your money.” "
  - "Substack is not the only alternative revenue source for musicians unhappy with streaming revenues alone. Ben Folds, Jacob Collier, Zola Jesus and Charly Bliss are all on Patreon, where fans pay $5-25/month for access to them on Discord channels, livestreams and Zoom chats. The metal band Trivium earned just under $10,000/month in 2020 from streaming on Twitch. Musicians such as Questlove, and Jesse Ware host podcasts, replete with ad sponsorship. You can find Japanese Breakfast hawking Patron on Instagram and Girlpool unboxing Marc Jacobs on TikTok."
