# Menu Management
Modern restaurants have menus in many places: 
- in-restaurant point-of-sale system;
- online restaurant website;
- paper or digital menus in the physical restaurant;
- online delivery platforms (ODPs), e.g. DoorDash, GrubHub, Postmates, Uber Eats;
- social media

Ideally a restaurant would have a single source of truth for the menu; updating this canonical menu would automatically trigger updates for all of the other menus.

Are there service providers that do this job?
